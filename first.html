                <p>All parrots have curved beaks and all are zygodactyls, 
                    meaning they have four toes on each foot, two pointing forward and two projecting backward.</p>

                <p>Description. The blue jay measures 22–30 cm (9–12 in) from bill
                     to tail and weighs 70–100 g (2.5–3.5 oz), with a wingspan of 34–43 cm (13–17 in).</p>

                <h2>Hummingbirds</h2>
                <p>Hummingbirds have compact bodies with relatively long, 
                    bladelike wings having anatomical structure enabling helicopter-like flight in any direction,
                    including the ability to hover. Particularly while hovering, the wing beats produce the humming sounds,
                    which function to alert other birds.</p>
